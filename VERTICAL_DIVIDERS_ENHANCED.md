Layer 2: Borders (NEW - Extra Prominent!)
├─ Left/Right borders: 2px solid at 35% opacity (for vertical)
└─ Top/Bottom borders: 2px solid at 35% opacity (for horizontal)

Layer 3: Center Line (Brighter!)
├─ 2px line at 80% opacity (increased from 60%)
├─ Perfectly centered
└─ Subtle glow: box-shadow 0 0 4px

Layer 4: Interactive Area
└─ Full 8px width/height clickable and hoverable
```
