- Git
- Basic knowledge of Rust, TypeScript, and React

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/frankvanlaarhoven/navlambda-studio.git
cd navlambda-studio

# Run setup script
chmod +x scripts/setup-dev-environment.sh
./scripts/setup-dev-environment.sh

# Start development server
npm run tauri:dev
```

## Development Process

### 1. Find or Create an Issue

- Check existing issues for something you'd like to work on
- For new features, create an issue first to discuss
- Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it

### 2. Fork and Branch

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/navlambda-studio.git

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clear, documented code
- Follow the coding standards below
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run Rust tests
cd src-tauri
cargo test

# Run frontend tests
npm run test

# Run linter
npm run lint
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>: <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Example:**
```
feat: Add quantum navigation operator

Implements the quantum evolution operator (‚Ñ∞) for
Van Laarhoven Navigation Calculus, enabling quantum-
inspired path optimization.

Closes #123
```

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

## Coding Standards

### Rust Code

```rust
// Use descriptive names
pub struct NavigationPath {
    waypoints: Vec<Point3D>,
    energy: f64,
}

// Document public APIs
/// Navigate from start to goal using VNC optimization.
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `start` - Starting position
/// * `goal` - Goal position
/// 
/// # Returns
/// Optimized navigation path
pub fn navigate_to_vnc(start: Point3D, goal: Point3D) -> NavigationPath {
    // Implementation
}

// Use Result for error handling
pub fn parse_code(code: &str) -> Result<Ast, ParseError> {
    // Implementation
}

// Follow Rust conventions
// - Snake case for functions and variables
// - PascalCase for types
// - SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
```

### TypeScript/React Code

```typescript
// Use TypeScript types
interface NavigationPath {
  waypoints: [number, number, number][];
  energy: number;
}

// Functional components with hooks
export const NavigationVisualizer: React.FC<Props> = ({ paths }) => {
  const [isAnimating, setIsAnimating] = useState(false);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect logic
  }, [paths]);
  
  return (
    <div className="visualizer">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

// Use async/await for promises
async function compileCode(code: string): Promise<CompiledOutput> {
  const result = await compilerService.compile(code);
  return result;
}
```

### Code Style

- **Indentation**: 2 spaces for TypeScript, 4 spaces for Rust
- **Line Length**: Maximum 100 characters
- **Comments**: Write clear, concise comments for complex logic
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, meaningful names

### Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Include examples in documentation
- Update README.md for significant features
- Add JSDoc/rustdoc comments

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```rust
// Rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_navigation_parsing() {
        let code = "navigate_to‚ãã(start, goal)";
        let result = parse_code(code);
        assert!(result.is_ok());
    }
}
```

```typescript
// TypeScript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('NavigationVisualizer', () => {
  it('should render paths correctly', () => {
    const paths = [/* test data */];
    const { container } = render(<NavigationVisualizer paths={paths} />);
    expect(container).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

- Test complete workflows
- Test cross-component interactions
- Test compilation to various targets

### Manual Testing

- Test in development mode
