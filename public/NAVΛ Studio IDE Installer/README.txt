NAVΛ Studio IDE - Installation Guide
=====================================

IMPORTANT: macOS Security Warning
==================================

When you first open "NAVΛ Studio IDE.app", macOS will show a security warning.
This is normal for unsigned apps.

TO OPEN THE APP:
================

Right-Click Method (Easiest):
1. Right-click (or Control+Click) on "NAVΛ Studio IDE.app"
2. Select "Open" from the menu
3. Click "Open" in the security dialog
4. The app will launch and be trusted for future use

INSTALLATION:
=============

1. After opening the app once, drag it to your Applications folder
2. The app will appear in Applications with the NAVΛ logo icon
3. You can add it to your Dock for quick access
4. Click the icon anytime to launch NAVΛ Studio IDE

The app opens the IDE at: http://localhost:5173 or https://navlambda.studio

NOTE: The app is safe - it's a simple launcher. The warning appears because
it's not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate.
