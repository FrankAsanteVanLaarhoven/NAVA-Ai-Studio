NAVΛ Studio IDE - Installation Instructions
===========================================

macOS Security Warning (Gatekeeper)
===================================

When you first try to open "NAVΛ Studio IDE.app", macOS will show a security warning because the app is not code-signed.

This is normal for apps that haven't been signed with an Apple Developer certificate.

HOW TO OPEN THE APP:
===================

Method 1: Right-Click and Open (Recommended)
---------------------------------------------
1. Right-click (or Control+Click) on "NAVΛ Studio IDE.app"
2. Select "Open" from the context menu
3. Click "Open" in the security dialog that appears
4. The app will now open and be added to your security exceptions

Method 2: System Settings
--------------------------
1. Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security
2. Scroll down to "Security"
3. You'll see a message about "NAVΛ Studio IDE.app" being blocked
4. Click "Open Anyway"
5. Confirm by clicking "Open" in the dialog

Method 3: Remove Quarantine Attribute (Advanced)
--------------------------------------------------
Open Terminal and run:
  xattr -cr "/path/to/NAVΛ Studio IDE.app"

INSTALLATION:
=============

After opening the app once:
1. Drag "NAVΛ Studio IDE.app" to your Applications folder
2. The app will appear in Applications with the NAVΛ logo
3. You can add it to your Dock for quick access
4. Double-click to launch the IDE

NOTE: The app is safe - it's just a launcher that opens the IDE in your browser.
The security warning appears because it's not signed with an Apple Developer certificate.

For production releases, the app should be code-signed with an Apple Developer ID.
