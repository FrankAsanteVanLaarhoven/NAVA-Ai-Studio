# Classical References (Concise)

- Newton's laws of motion — basis for simple dynamic models.
- Euclidean geometry — frames, distances, angles.
- Markov processes — stochastic decision modeling.
- Lyapunov stability — control convergence criteria.
- Damped least squares — IK robustness near singularities.

We align operational claims with these established results; we do not assert
new proofs of unrelated open problems.
