# Mathematical Foundations

We ground NAVΛ in classical results and practical control theorems:

- **Euclidean geometry** (frames, transforms)
- **Calculus of variations** (path optimality)
- **Markov decision processes** (intent under uncertainty)
- **Lyapunov stability** (controller convergence)
- **Damped least-squares IK** (near-singularity robustness)
- **Collision geometry** via FCL

We cite well-known results and provide reproducible derivations tailored to our
runtime, avoiding claims beyond established mathematics.
