# Benchmarks

- **Latency & Jitter**: 30/60/120 Hz followers, planner bursts (N=100).
- **Path fidelity**: curvature-limited tracks vs ground truth.
- **Collision safety**: randomized keep-outs, moving obstacles with CV rollouts.
- **XR operator efficiency**: task completion time with/without presets.

All benchmark **fixtures** live in scenario catalogs; results are captured as
Evidence Packs and summarized in the Release manifest.
