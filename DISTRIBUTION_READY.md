};
```

---

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### **What Users See:**

1. Visit your landing page
2. **Auto-detection** shows their OS (e.g., "We detected you're on macOS")
3. Click **"Download Now"** button
4. DMG file downloads automatically
5. Instructions appear:
   ```
   🎉 Downloading NAVΛ Studio for macOS!

   📦 Installation Instructions:
   1. Open the downloaded .dmg file
   2. Drag NAVΛ Studio to your Applications folder
   3. Right-click the app and select "Open" (first time only)
   4. Click "Open" again in the security dialog

   ⚠️ macOS Security Note:
   macOS will show a security warning because this app isn't code-signed.
   This is normal! Just right-click > Open to bypass it.
   After the first time, you can open it normally.
   ```

### **What Users Get:**

- ✅ **212MB DMG file** (self-contained!)
- ✅ **Drag & drop installation** (easy!)
- ✅ **App in Applications folder** (standard!)
- ✅ **Launchable from Dock** (convenient!)
- ✅ **Full IDE functionality** (powerful!)

### **⚠️ Important: macOS Security Warning**

Since the app is **unsigned** (no Apple Developer certificate), users will see this warning on first launch:

```
"NAVΛ Studio.app" cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.
```

**How to open:**
1. Right-click (or Control+click) on the app
2. Select "Open" from the menu
3. Click "Open" again in the dialog

After this one-time process, the app opens normally!

**Why this happens:**
- App isn't code-signed with Apple Developer certificate ($99/year)
- Normal for development/beta distribution
- Users can still install and use safely

**For future:** See `MACOS_SECURITY_GUIDE.md` for code signing instructions.

## 🔧 How the App Works

1. **Self-contained** - Has all dependencies bundled
2. **Runs locally** - Starts a local server when launched
3. **Opens browser** - Chrome app mode (no browser UI)
4. **No Node.js required** - Python3 is used (pre-installed on macOS)
5. **Full IDE** - All features work offline
