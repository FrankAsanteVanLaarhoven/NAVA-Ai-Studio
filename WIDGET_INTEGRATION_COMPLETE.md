# Widget System Integration Complete

## Summary

The widget system has been successfully integrated into the NAVÎ› Studio IDE. This enhancement provides users with additional productivity tools and utilities that can be accessed through a floating widget manager.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Widget Components
- **Calculator Widget**: A fully functional calculator with basic arithmetic operations
- **Notes Widget**: A note-taking application with:
  - Create, edit, and delete notes
  - Search functionality
  - Color-coded notes
  - Auto-save to localStorage
  - Markdown support
- **File Explorer Widget**: A mock file system explorer with folder navigation
- **Terminal Widget**: A simulated terminal with mock ROS commands

### 2. Widget Management System
- **Widget Manager**: A floating panel that allows users to:
  - Browse available widgets by category (Productivity, Development, Utility)
  - Open widgets with a single click
  - View widget descriptions and icons
- **Drag and Drop**: All widgets can be dragged around the screen
- **Resizable**: Notes, File Explorer, and Terminal widgets can be resized
- **Persistent State**: Widget positions and sizes are saved to localStorage

### 3. Integration with Main App
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+W` (or `Cmd+Shift+W` on Mac) to open the Widget Manager
- **Command Palette**: Added "widgets" and "widget-manager" commands
- **Voice Commands**: Can be opened via voice commands

## Usage

1. **Opening Widget Manager**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+W` (or `Cmd+Shift+W` on Mac)
   - Use Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type "widgets"
   - Use voice command "widgets" or "widget manager"

2. **Using Widgets**:
   - Click on any widget in the Widget Manager to open it
   - Drag widgets by their title bar to reposition
   - Resize supported widgets by dragging their edges
   - Close widgets using the X button in the title bar

3. **Widget Categories**:
   - **Productivity**: Notes
   - **Development**: File Explorer, Terminal
   - **Utility**: Calculator

## Technical Implementation

- All widgets are React functional components with TypeScript
- CSS modules for styling with consistent theming
- Local storage for persistence
- Event handlers for drag and resize functionality
- Modular architecture for easy addition of new widgets

## Future Enhancements

- Add more widgets (Timer, Todo List, Code Snippets, etc.)
- Implement widget docking/snapping
- Add widget settings and customization
- Create widget marketplace for community widgets
- Add real file system integration for File Explorer
- Connect Terminal widget to actual ROS backend
