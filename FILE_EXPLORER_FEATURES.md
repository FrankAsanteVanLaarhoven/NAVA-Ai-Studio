## 📋 **How It Works**

### **File/Folder Placement Logic**
1. **If you select a folder**: New items are created inside it
2. **If you select a file**: New items are created in the file's parent folder
3. **Default**: If nothing is selected, items are created in the root folder

### **Sorting Logic**
- Folders always appear before files
- Within folders/files, items are sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive)
- This maintains a clean, organized structure

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements** (Not Yet Implemented)

These features could be added next:
- ❌ Delete files/folders
- ❌ Rename files/folders
- ❌ Drag & drop to reorder/move
- ❌ File icons based on extension
- ❌ Right-click context menu
- ❌ Keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
- ❌ Search/filter files
- ❌ File size and modified date

---

## 💾 **Important Note**

⚠️ **These files/folders exist only in the UI state**

Currently, the Explorer manages files in memory (React state) only. To persist files to the actual file system, we would need to integrate with:
- Backend API (for web version)
- Tauri file system API (for desktop version)
- IndexedDB or localStorage (for browser persistence)

This is the **visual foundation** that can easily be connected to real file operations later!
