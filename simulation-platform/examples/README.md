## Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the warehouse world to familiarize yourself with controls
2. **Test Navigation**: Use obstacle course for algorithm validation
3. **Scale Appropriately**: Keep obstacle scales realistic (1 unit = 1 meter)
4. **Lighting Matters**: Adjust ambient and directional light for visualization
5. **Battery Management**: Set appropriate battery capacity for your use case

---

## API Integration

These worlds can also be loaded via the web API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3030/api/load_world \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @examples/warehouse_world.json
```
