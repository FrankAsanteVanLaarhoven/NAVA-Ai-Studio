## 💻 Code Examples

### Traditional ROS2 vs. NAVΛ Enhanced

#### Traditional ROS2 Approach
```cpp
// Standard velocity publisher
geometry_msgs::msg::Twist cmd;
cmd.linear.x = 0.5;  // Fixed velocity
cmd.angular.z = 0.1; // Fixed turn rate
publisher_->publish(cmd);
```

#### NAVΛ Enhanced Approach
```vnc
// Define navigation field with energy function
⋋ robot_field: ℝ² → TM = {
    position: vector2(x, y),
    velocity: vector2(vx, vy),
    goal: vector2(10, 10),
    
    // Energy = distance to goal + obstacle avoidance
    energy: |position - goal|² + obstacle_potential(position)
}

// Compute OPTIMAL velocity via gradient descent
⋋ optimal_velocity = -∇energy(robot_field.position)

// Automatically publish to ROS2
@ros2_publish("cmd_vel", optimal_velocity)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Mathematically optimal paths
- ✅ Provably correct
- ✅ Real-time adaptation
- ✅ Energy-efficient motion
